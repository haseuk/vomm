            The Samsung DVM S2 is capable of delivering a high heating capacity at extremely low ambient temperatures in a reliable and energy-efficient way. Its base design helps drain condensed water fast, and a base heater melts any ice that forms inside.

          <p class="cont-p cont-p1">
            During the heating operation in cold weather, the defrost cycle used to remove ice on a heat exchanger can cause water to condense on it. The DVM S2 has a patented base design with drainage holes that cover a 6.6 times larger area, so it drains condensed water much faster to prevent it from freezing inside the cabinet.

          <p class="cont-sub-tit">Base Heater** (Optional)</p>
          <p class="cont-p cont-p2">
            In areas of high humidity with extremely cold temperatures of -25°C or below, it is possible that ice can still build-up on a base, even if it drains water effectively. So, the DVM S2 has an option to include a base heater that can quickly melt ice on the base and ensure the reliability of its heating operation.
          </p>

            * The capacities are based on DVM S2 models.<br>
            ** Optional. Available in the second half of 2021. Varies based on the base size of an outdoor unit, and may differ by line-up and region.
