          <p class="cont-no">1. Efficiency</p>
          <p class="cont-p">
            <span>"Top-class seasonal energy efficiency"</span>
            The DVM S2 has been radically redesigned to reduce the operating costs with unique technologies that are significantly more efficient. As a result, it is proven to improve seasonal energy efficiency by around 11% across a range of capacities*, on average.
          </p>
          <p class="cont-no">2. Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
          <p class="cont-p">
            <span>"AI innovation"</span>
            By learning usage patterns from recent operations and the surrounding conditions, the DVM S2 proactively creates, optimizes and maintains the most comfortable environment, while reducing energy consumption.
          </p>
          <p class="cont-no">3. Servicing & Installation</p>
          <p class="cont-p">
            <span>"Convenient and cost-effective installation<br> and servicing"</span>
            The DVM S2 requires less refrigerant when using a slimmer liquid pipe, which also means you can design the entire system more flexibly and install it with less effort and lower costs. And On-Device Inverter Check™ and S-converter simplify the process of checking errors, so the servicing is easier and takes less time.
          </p>
          <p class="cont-no">4. Line-up</p>
          <p class="cont-p">
            <span>"Wide and varied line-up of indoor units"</span>
            The DVM S2 is perfectly compatible with almost all kinds of Samsung indoor units, including the state-of-the-art WindFree™ air conditioners and 360 Cassette. In particular, it controls the compressor more precisely, so it enhances their ability to deliver WindFree™ comfort in the optimal way.
          </p>
          <p class="txt">
            * Based on testing in accordance with the Eurovent testing rule, at the end of December 2020. Tested on 22.4~56kW models of the Samsung DVM S2 compared to the same capacities of another brand, using ducted type indoor units.
