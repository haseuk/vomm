            Samsung is one of the world’s leading companies, with an outstanding brand value.<br>
            <br>
            According to the official report of Interbrand, Samsung entered the list of top 5 brands in 2020, and is the first non-US company in the world to be ranked in the top 5. Samsung’s brand value is $62.3 billion, which increased by 2% compared to the last year, despite an uncertain business environment as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world.<br>
            <br>
            Samsung has been deploying various social contributions and campaigns in response to COVID-19, and expanding sustainable activities across all business areas and functions. We have also been continuously introducing innovative products, such as the Galaxy Z Flip smartphone, the Terrace TV, Bespoke, and the 360 Cassette and WindFree™ air conditioners. These are the key factors that have been driving the relentless progress of the Samsung brand.<br>
            <br>
            As well as entering the top 5 of “Best Global Brands” by Interbrand, Samsung was ranked 1st in the ”World’s Best Employers” and 8th in the “The World’s Most Valuable Brands 2020”, awarded by Forbes. These achievements show that Samsung is truly one of the most valuable brands in the world, and is undoubtedly the leading brand in the air conditioning industry.
