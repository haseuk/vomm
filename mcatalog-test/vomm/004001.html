            Air conditioning systems are a major consumer of energy, and account for about 30%* of the total energy used in a building.<br>
            So, energy efficiency is usually the most important factor that consultants and designers consider when deciding which air conditioning system to purchase and install in a building. The Samsung VRF systems already lead the industry in energy efficiency. And now the new DVM S2 outdoor unit is pushing back the boundaries even further. It incorporates many new and unique technologies that deliver the next level of energy efficiency, along with a superior performance.<br>
            On average, the Samsung DVM S2 is proven to be around 11% more energy efficient across a range of capacities**.
