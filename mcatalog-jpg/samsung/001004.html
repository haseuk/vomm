            In line with Samsung’s unwavering commitment to being an eco-responsible organization, the DVM S2’s radical new design incorporates a range of technologies that minimize its impact on the environment. As well as transferring heat much more efficiently, so it consumes much less energy, it also intelligently optimizes its cooling performance to reduce any waste. In addition, its improved sub-cooling rate and Advanced Flash Injection significantly reduce the amount of refrigerant required, making it much more environmentally friendly and reducing harmful CO₂ emissions.

            <p class="cont-sub-tit t1">minimizes waste<br class="mo">of energy</p>
            <p class="cont-p cont-p1 p1">The DVM S2 has been redesigned to cut the cost of
              cooling with energy-efficient technologies. The enlarged Heat Exchanger has a much greater transfer area to exchange heat faster. An optimized refrigerant path also matches the air flow speed to improve the transfer of heat. An aerodynamic Multi-serration Fan generates more air flow while consuming less electricity as it minimizes air turbulence. And a 7th generation insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), which switches current and frequency to suit the system, reduces the loss of conducted electricity.</p>

            <p class="cont-p cont-p1 p2">The DVM S2 optimizes its cooling performance
              automatically, based on a learning and optimizing
              algorithm about the installation conditions and usage patterns. Active AI Pressure Control intelligently adjusts the refrigerant condensing pressure and evaporating pressure, so it cools faster and reduces energy usage. Active AI Defrost ensures it defrosts more precisely, so it increases the continuous heating time significantly. And Active AI Refrigerant Analysis proactively monitors and helps maintain the optimum level of refrigerant.</p>

            <p class="cont-p cont-p1 p3">The DVM S2 saves money and helps protect the
              environment with its efficient and flexible piping system. It is equipped with a high-performance sub-cooler that improves the sub-cooling rate of refrigerant. Its slimmer liquid pipe also means it requires 25% less refrigerant compared to a normal pipe, on average. So it reduces the costs of installation and maintenance and also provides added flexibility in designing the entire system. In addition, by using less refrigerant, it is much more
              environmentally friendly.</p>

            <p class="cont-sub-tit t4">replaces<br class="mo">fossil fuel</p>
            <p class="cont-p cont-p1 p4">The DVM S2 introduces a new era of eco-friendly
              performance and efficiency. It features Advanced Flash Injection technology with a new Triple Profile Wrap and Optimal Discharge Superheat (DSH) Control. The improved strength of its Flash Injection, which delivers superior heating in frozen conditions, means that the capacity is now much larger (90cc). So it is powerful enough to replace conventional heating methods that use fossil fuel. And its highly efficient Optimal DSH Control saves even more energy, which helps to reduce CO₂ emission.</p>
