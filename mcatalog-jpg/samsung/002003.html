          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit1">CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic)</p>
          <p class="cont-p cont-p1">The installation location and surrounding conditions significantly impact the performance of an air conditioning system. In particular, these days the structure of buildings has become more complex and often includes a machine room to hide outdoor units, so they are not visible on the outside. As a result, it is much more important to determine in advance if the preferred location will have any impact on the performance of the system. Samsung supports CFD simulation and analysis to assess the performance of the Samsung air conditioning system before deciding on its installation location, and also provides a guidance report if it is necessary to change it.</p>

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit2">Noise Analysis</p>
          <p class="cont-p cont-p2">To ensure a more comfortable indoor environment, noise mitigation is now an important factor. So, it’s essential to anticipate possible noises during the building planning stage – before they really happen. Samsung provides noise effect evaluation, based on the location of indoor and outdoor units, by modeling the actual building design and data about the air conditioning system. After the evaluation, Samsung will suggest the best choice of installation location, and also provides a guidance report if necessary.</p>

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit3">Energy Simulation</p>
          <p class="cont-p cont-p3">In general buildings, the HVAC (Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning) products usually consume around 30% of the total energy used in the building. Samsung helps conduct energy simulations to analyze the economical efficiency of the installed HVAC systems by evaluating the operation cost of each product category. This enables developers and consultants to propose the optimal HVAC solution to their clients.</p>
