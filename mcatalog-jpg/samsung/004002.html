            Some environments present a real challenge to the effective operation of an air conditioning system. Extreme temperatures, persistently wet conditions and even earthquakes will not only impact the performance, but can also drastically shorten its working life.<br>
            <br>
            The Samsung DVM S2 outdoor unit’s robust design is capable of coping with the most challenging forces of nature. As well as continually fine-tuning the flow of refrigerant using a new 90cc Scroll Compressor, its unique Dual Heat Sink radiates heat effectively from the inverter circuit. So, it delivers an extremely reliable performance across a wide range of temperatures.<br>
            <br>
            It is also built to withstand severe physical shocks, including sizeable earthquakes, and has significantly improved<br class="web"> anti-corrosion capabilities to ensure maximum durability.
