            Corrosion-resistance is a very important factor in outdoor units, as they need to withstand a range of climate conditions. The Samsung DVM S2 features improved anti-corrosion capabilities on the heat exchanger and chassis to ensure maximum durability in harsh environments*.

            The Samsung DVM S2 outdoor unit’s Durafin™ Ultra has an anti-corrosive layer of epoxy acrylic and a hydrophilic layer of acrylic resin that disperses water and reinforces its corrosion-resistance. Its superb quality was proven using the Salt Spray Test (SST) over a period of 3,000 hours*.

          <p class="cont-p cont-p1">
            The Samsung DVM S2 uses Galvanized Iron Steel Plate as  its external material, with a PE powder coating of up to 100µm thickness. This powerful combination is proven to improve corrosion-resistance by 43%, based on the Complex Cycle Test (CCT)**. So, it protects the cabinet from rusting and ensures it can endure harsh conditions.

            * Based on testing by TUV Rheinland in accordance with method B of ISO 9227, ISO 14993 and ISO 21207 using specimens from the heat exchanger, cabinet and screw of the Samsung DVM S2. For more details, please contact Samsung’s technical professionals.<br>
            ** Based on internal testing using corrosion chambers, Q-FOG and CCT-1100. The Complex Cycle Test (CCT) includes cycles of spray (for 2 hours at 35°C), dry (for 4 hours at 60°C with 30% Relative Humidity) and damp (for 2 hours at 50°C with 95% Relative Humidity) conditions. As a result, the Galvanized Iron Steel Plate (GI) formed red rust after 240 hours, which is 43% slower than general Electro-Galvanized Steel Plate (EGI) which forms red rust after 168 hours.
