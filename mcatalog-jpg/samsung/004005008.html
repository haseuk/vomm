            The Samsung DVM S2 has various convenient features that help installers and service providers to lift and move, and disassemble and assemble it with added safety and less effort.

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit1">Center Point Indicator of Weight</p>
          <p class="cont-p cont-p2">
            VRF outdoor units usually weigh a lot and can sometimes be over 300kg. It is obviously very difficult and dangerous to handle such heavy machines, so the Samsung DVM S2 has a removable indicator to show its center of weight. It makes it much safer to lift and move with a crane or a forklift as it helps to prevent the unit from becoming unbalanced and tilting or toppling over.

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit1">Simplified Cover with Handle</p>
          <p class="cont-p">
            The front cover of conventional outdoor units consists of multiple pieces, which means it can require a lot of work to open them fully. The Samsung DVM S2’s front cover is a single piece, so it’s simple to open and access every part inside the outdoor unit, which reduces the time and effort for servicing.

            In addition, the cover has a handle that provides added safety and convenience when handling.
