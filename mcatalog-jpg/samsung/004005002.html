            The Samsung DVM S2 consists of optimized modular components, which have fewer parts. In particular, based on its Quality-based Modular Design (QMD), the DVM S2 is built with high-quality modules that have been preselected and preconfigured. So, it delivers both superior performance and reliability, while also significantly reducing the number of parts that need servicing.

            This modular design simplifies the entire process of maintenance and service, as less time and effort is required to check and fix any issues. And, from the viewpoint of warehousing, it also saves space as there is no need to store a lot of parts.
