            In 2019, we celebrated our 50th anniversary by announcing a new global vision for our corporate citizenship: Together for Tomorrow! Enabling People. The new vision draws on our core values of People, Co-prosperity, and Change, and encompasses our promise to cultivate talented individuals for shared growth, while pursuing innovations that will help make the world a better place.<br>
            <br>
            As part of this vision, we seek to empower future generations to achieve their full potential, enabling them to pioneer positive social change and build a better world for all. Our programs focus on providing equal opportunities for quality education to young people around the world.<br>
            <br>
            Our global citizenship programs harness the power of our collective expertise, technology, experience, and resources. They are also customized to suit each country's characteristics in order to ensure that they have the maximum impact.

            In addition, we operate tailored country-level programs and collaborate with governments, policymakers and institutions to provide a wide variety of engaging learning opportunities.
