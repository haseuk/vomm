            As a global corporate citizen, Samsung is acutely aware of our obligations and roles in sustainable operations. As well as strengthening our climate change response activities we also endeavor to comply with international environmental standards, as well as European and national laws and regulations, across our global business operations. We are actively taking steps to minimize the generation of harmful materials, utilize resources efficiently and recycle waste products for the benefit of the environment.
            We are also doing our best to minimize the environmental impact of our product
            development, production, distribution, sales and disposal processes, while extending the life cycle of our products.

          <p class="cont-p cont-p1 p1">Samsung works within the WEEE (Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment) regulations, which form the Directive for extended producer responsibility. This Directive mandates the safe collection, treatment, recycling and environmentally-sound disposal of all electrical and electronic equipment. Working with collective recycling schemes in each EU member state, Samsung co-finances the take-back and recycling of electronic products.</p>

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit1 t2"><img src="http://www.vo-mm.com/Samsung/M-Catalogue-v2/img/001003_02.png" alt="" class="img2 mo">Ecodesign</p>
          <p class="cont-p cont-p1 p2">Samsung complies with the Ecodesign regulations, issued in March 2012. These require electric air conditioners (<12kW) and comfort fans (<125W) within the EU to display detailed, highly visible information
            regarding energy efficiency, plus information on Seasonal Coefficient
            of Performance (SCOP), Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) and
            annual energy consumption (kW/h).</p>

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit1 t3"><img src="http://www.vo-mm.com/Samsung/M-Catalogue-v2/img/001003_03.png" alt="" class="img3 mo">Packaging</p>
          <p class="cont-p cont-p1 p3">Samsung works together with recycling schemes and governmental organizations to collect, separate and reuse all packaging materials at various points in the distribution chain. Many materials can be recycled
            into new products, which helps to save natural resources. Recycling
            packaging also helps to reuse valuable raw materials and to reduce the overall impact on the environment.</p>

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit2 t4">Climate Actions</p>
          <img src="http://www.vo-mm.com/Samsung/M-Catalogue-v2/img/001003_04.jpg" alt="" class="mo">
          <p class="cont-p cont-p2 p4">In line with the Paris Agreement signed in December 2015, Samsung has been taking action to tackle the issues of climate change. We identify related issues, analyze risks, and establish and implement effective counterstrategies and develop energy-efficient products. We regularly discuss climate actions through committees and councils, are committed to sourcing renewable energy for 100% of our worksites and manage their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions through the Global Environment, Health, and Safety System (G-EHS). In addition, we are working with suppliers, the Samsung institute of Safety & Environment and related departments to reduce other indirect GHG emissions created by activities such as product transportation and business travel.</p>

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit2 t5">Circular Economy</p>
          <img src="http://www.vo-mm.com/Samsung/M-Catalogue-v2/img/001003_05.jpg" alt="" class="mo">
          <p class="cont-p cont-p2 p5">As natural resources run out, sustainability across all
            stages of the product life-cycle is becoming increasingly important, from materials purchasing, development, and manufacturing to logistics, use and disposal. We have established circular economy principles that close the loop and expand the reuse and recycling of our resources to minimize the social and environmental impacts. These include the increased use of sustainable materials, extending the product lifespan, and minimizing the use of natural resources and raw materials. In order to turn these principles into reality, we have also developed a
            number of key mid-to long-term goals, such as 100% use of sustainably-sourced paper in packaging and the use of 500,000 tonnes of recycled plastics by 2030.</p>

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit2 t6">Operations</p>
          <img src="http://www.vo-mm.com/Samsung/M-Catalogue-v2/img/001003_06.jpg" alt="" class="mo">
          <p class="cont-p cont-p2 p6">We are committed to reducing the environmental
            impact of our business operations. Our slogan of “Planet First” expresses our commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability management. We focus on 3R activities - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle – to use less and recycle more. In 2019, we recycled 95% of our waste. We also strive to minimize the amount of water used in the manufacturing process, while maximizing waste
            water purification and its subsequent reuse. In 2019, 51% of our water was reused – a massive 68.55 million tonnes. In addition, we operate a management system to treat pollutants by appropriate processes and are engaged in a range of activities designed to help preserve biodiversity in the regions where we do business.</p>

          <p class="cont-sub-tit cont-sub-tit2 t7">Product Stewardship</p>
          <img src="http://www.vo-mm.com/Samsung/M-Catalogue-v2/img/001003_07.jpg" alt="" class="mo">
          <p class="cont-p cont-p2 p7">We operate an Eco-conscious Product Policy through
            which we strive to enhance our product stewardship and minimize the environmental impacts throughout the entire product life cycle – from purchasing raw materials, to development, manufacturing, distribution, usage, and disposal. Right from the product design stage, we apply our Eco-Design Process to assess the level of resources and energy we use, as well as the harmfulness of the raw materials utilized in products. This enables us to plan and develop products that have greater energy
            efficiency, use fewer resources, and do not include
            hazardous substances and chemicals. For example, our air conditioners’ WindFree™ Cooling mode reduces energy use by up to 58% compared to the normal mode.</p>
